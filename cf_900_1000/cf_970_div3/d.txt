the algo that i have thought is that 
we create an empty 2D array and then we iterate through the elements in the given array,
we access the element in the current index we are getting and get appending the elements to the 
first list in the first 2D array till we repeat on to the same element we started on...
also while going through this loop we keep a track of the black numbers we have encountered
and append it to another array...
now the problem comes when we try to keep a track of the elements which we have already covered...
we need to solve this somehow once this has been solved... we can append the remaining elements 
forming the cyclic group to the 2D array accordingly, and also the num of black elements for that

We solve the problem using sets() we check that the number we land on is in the set or not
if its already there we break the loop or else move onto the next element

after this is complete we iterate through the elements in the 2D array and in a new array set 
the val of new_arr[2D_array[i][j]] = black_num[i]

and return this array... thus solving our question
