the idea for the interesting ratio is that
f = lcm/gcd
where f is prime hence lcm = gcd * p where p is a prime
also a*b = lcm * gcd 
hence a* b = p * gcd^2

now the gcd is the greatest factor which divides both a and b hence a = gcd and b = p*gcd as (a<b)
hence b = p*a 

and we take different values of a multiply it with prime numbers and generate b until the given limit is reached
