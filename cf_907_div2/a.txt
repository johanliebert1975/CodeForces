the main idea behind this question is that whether the numbers in the range 2^m - 2^(m-1) form an increasing sequence or not... for 
all possible n such that 2^m <= n...
this is because we can only effectively decrease the numbers in that range... without affecting their order.... so the net effect is the one 
mentioned above...

also if for some min possible value of m such that 2^m > n then we set the upper bound of the check to n and check whether the numbers in the range
n,2^(m-1) are in an increasing sequence or not
