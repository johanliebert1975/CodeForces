the algo will be a simple brue force algoritm:
we store the numbers of T,I and L initially in the string in array and set the maximum numeber of possible insertions to 2*len(string)
then we iterate form index 1 to n-2 in the array checking whether the current and the next index is unequal or not
if not we put letter that is not there and increment it in the array that we created... and check whether the number of all the elements
becomes equal if not we move to the next letter which is now the newly inserted letter and check if insertion is possible or not
if not then move to the next else insert and check the counter array after incrementing the val of the inserted letter and whether all 
of then become equal or not... go on doing this for 2n possible moves...
if at any stage the desired is achieved then return the number of moves done 
else return -1
