one possible algo to solve this question how be to come from both the sides of the stirng till we hit the first 
letter that does not match and check if the one on the first end is smaller than the one on the other end... 
if it is... then print 'yes' else swap it if it is within the given range of permissible swaps

so in theory every word can be made universal unless all the letters innit are same or the given number of swaps is 0 and the the word
is already not universal
