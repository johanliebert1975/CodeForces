say we are given an array of numbers and we add some number d to all the numbers such that
later we need to select two numbers from the array such that the gcd of the two numbers should be
maximum of all the possible selections

now it can be shown that for any two numbers a and b where a < b the max possible value of 
gcd(a,b) = a and if for any two numbers in the array if we were to maximise the gcd between them for 
any two numbers... we would need to add such a number so that they become the multiples of the difference
between them

and hence the gcd will be then equal to their difference after the addition...
so to maximise the gcd... for all possible selections we need to have the difference between the min and max of the given integer
array
